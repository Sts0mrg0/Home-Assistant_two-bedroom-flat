______________

Automation was done using the [Wifi IoT Relay Board Based on ESP8266](https://www.electrodragon.com/product/wifi-iot-relay-board-based-esp8266/) relay and the [Sonoff Basic WiFi Wireless Switch](https://www.itead.cc/smart-home/sonoff-wifi-wireless-switch.html) with [Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota) firmware. Relays are installed in oversized junction boxes in the walls of the apartment. To receive data from sensors and partially to control the relay, a multifunctional MegaD-2561 controller is used.
